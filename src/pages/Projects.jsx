            I am an analytical and creative web developer with an
            interdisciplinary background and over three years of experience in
            building design systems and pattern libraries using native web
            technologies. <br />
            <br />
            Passionate about component-based development, I have gained hands-on
            experience with React and am actively expanding my expertise in web
            accessibility. Committed to creating inclusive digital experiences,
            I have deepened my knowledge through extensive study and completion
            of the W3Cx: Introduction to Web Accessibility course, enabling me
            to develop user-friendly and compliant products.
